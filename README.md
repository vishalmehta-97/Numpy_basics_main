All about Numpy ( Standard Python Library )

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fast and powerful open-source library designed for scientific and numerical computing. It provides a high-performance N-dimensional array object, enabling lightning-fast mathematical operations, matrix computations, and large-scale data manipulation — far beyond the capabilities of standard Python lists.

Built on highly optimized C code, NumPy supports vectorized operations, broadcasting, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, random sampling, statistics, reshaping, slicing, and memory-efficient computations. It serves as the core foundation of the modern Python data ecosystem, powering libraries like Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Matplotlib, and more.

Whether you're working in Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI, Image Processing, Scientific Research, or Engineering, NumPy is the essential tool that unlocks high-performance computing with clean and efficient syntax.
